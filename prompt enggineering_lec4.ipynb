    "I enjoyed this book very much, enough to have bought another book by this author since. The protagonist Hari had been an achiever at school but when he gets into the elite Indian Institute of Technology, the going gets very tough- so tough, in fact, that he is no longer a high flier but instead, the five-pointer of the title. He teams up with Ryan and Alok, and their efforts to improve their grades are hilarious and at times cringe-makingly embarrassing. You want to say to him, Don't do that, it's not worth it! Sometimes it leads to pure farce but always page-turningly entertaining and moves at a pace\n",
